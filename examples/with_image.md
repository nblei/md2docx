# Image Example

This document demonstrates embedding images in a markdown file and converting them to DOCX.

![{"scale": 0.25, "ref": "logo-small"}](../data/University-of-Michigan-Logo.png "University of Michigan Logo")

Additional text after the image to show how content flows.

## Second Image Example

We can include multiple images that get automatic figure numbering:

![{"scale": 0.5, "ref": "logo-large"}](../data/University-of-Michigan-Logo.png "Second University of Michigan Logo" )

Text after the second image.

We can reference Figure {ref: logo-large} as such.
