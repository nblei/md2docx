## Images

Images can be customized by inserting JSON into the `alt` field.  Currently, `md2docx` supports:

1. `scale: float` --- Image size scaling
2. `ref: string` --- Image label

An image label can be referenced in text using the `ref` keyword inside curly brackets:

Images can also be captioned.

```
![{"scale": 0.5, "ref": "a-scaled-image"}][url "Figure Caption"]

{ref: a-scaled-image} is scaled to 50% of its true size.
```

## YAML Front Matter

The YAML Front Matter supports several fields.

1. `title` is the title of the document/paper.
2. `author` is the name of the author.
3. `affiliation` is the author's affiliation.

Currently, only single authors are supported.
